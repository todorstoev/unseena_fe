This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

Boilerplate for NextJS projects with all the necessary tools and configurations.

## Requirements

1. Node.js
2. pnpm
3. Graphviz
4. Playwright
5. Visual Studio Code or any other IDE
6. OXC for Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE with OXC support)
7. Prettier for Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE with Prettier support)

## Getting Started

2. Run `npm install -g pnpm` to install pnpm.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm dev` to start the app.
5. Open `localhost:3000` in your browser.
6. Install Graphviz from [here](https://graphviz.org/download/) to run the graphviz visualizer.
